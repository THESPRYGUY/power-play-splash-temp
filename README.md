# Power Play Splash — Designed Pages (Draft)

This is a lightweight static HTML/CSS implementation of the athlete splash pages.

## Run locally
From `power-play-splash/site`:

```bash
npx -y serve -l 5177
```

Then open:
- http://localhost:5177/ (index)
- http://localhost:5177/kelly-rudney/

## Replace imagery
For Kelly:
- `kelly-rudney/assets/hero.svg` is a placeholder.
- Replace it with a real `hero.jpg` (preferred) and update `index.html` (or keep the same filename).

Suggested sizes:
- Hero portrait: ~1600×2000 (4:5)
- OG image: 1200×630

## Design system
- `shared/styles.css` is the global Power Play look.
- Keep pages fast: minimal JS, simple sections, strong hero + proof.
